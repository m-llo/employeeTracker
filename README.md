# Employee Tracker

 My challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.Containing three tables department, role, and department. Thal 
 allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

I've also included the ability to:

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees


## User Story
